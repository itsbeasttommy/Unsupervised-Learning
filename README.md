# Unsupervised-Learning
Beginner Python Coding Test: Unsupervised Learning
Overview
This Python test focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes customer data with features like Annual Income and Spending Score. The test involves loading, exploring, normalizing the dataset, and applying clustering algorithms to derive insights and strategies.

Sections
Dataset Loading & Exploration: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and visualize basic statistics.

KMeans Clustering: Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers based on income and spending score, evaluate cluster performance, and interpret results.

Hierarchical Clustering: Use hierarchical clustering to create clusters and compare them with KMeans results.

Interpretation & Strategy: Analyze cluster characteristics and suggest marketing or retention strategies for different customer segments.

Requirements
pandas

sklearn

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy

Deliverables
Python code with explanations and comments.

Plots and visualizations of clustering results.

Interpretation and strategy suggestions for each identified customer segment.
